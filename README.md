HR Attrition Analysis¶
In the business world, companies often face the challenge of retaining talented
employees. One of the most pressing issues is the increasing rate of employee
turnover, commonly known as HR attrition. Turnover can have a significant impact on
a company’s productivity, stability, and long-term sustainability. High attrition rates
can lead to increased recruitment and training costs, disrupt team dynamics, and
result in the loss of valuable institutional knowledge. Therefore, understanding the
factors contributing to attrition and implementing effective retention strategies is
crucial for maintaining a competitive edge and ensuring
Objectives of the Analysis
1. Understand Current Turnover Rates: Gain a comprehensive understanding of
the current employee turnover rate and analyze the demographic distribution of
attrition by age, gender, education, department, and job role.
2. Identify Key Factors Influencing Turnover: Examine the main factors
contributing to employee attrition, including job satisfaction indicators (job
involvement and work-life balance), salary factors (monthly income and salary
hikes), and benefit factors (stock option levels), to uncover patterns and
correlations that drive higher attrition rates.
